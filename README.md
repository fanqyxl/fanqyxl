# So, this is embarrassing

Basically, on 08/19/2025, @kxtzownsu had hacked into most of my accounts including google, decided to nuke my repos, and has also been keeping my personal information in a txt file.

I'll try to bring back up all my repos when I have the chance, but no guarantee (as commit history is all wiped!)
